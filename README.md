# MExNetS
Mass Exchanger Network Synthesis for packed column networks using a hybrid strategy. Currently under development. 

(Published as "Synthesis of mass exchanger networks in a two-step hybrid optimization strategy", 2018, Michael Short, Adeniyi J. Isafiade, Lorenz T. Biegler, Zdravko Kravanja)

Currently highly unstable and still under development. Need to have Ipopt and Bonmin installed installed. Those are the only 2 supported solvers at the moment. Change location of exe in MENS_MINLP.py module. Many parts of the program require refinement.
