# MExNetS
Mass Exchanger Network Synthesis for packed column networks using a hybrid optimisation strategy. Currently under development. 

(Published as "Synthesis of mass exchanger networks in a two-step hybrid optimization strategy", 2018, Michael Short, Adeniyi J. Isafiade, Lorenz T. Biegler, Zdravko Kravanja)

Currently quite experimental and relatively stable. Still under development. At a minimum one needs to have Ipopt and Bonmin solvers installed, however it is advised that you 
have GAMS installed with BARON and DICOPT solvers selected as well for full functionality, with all of those added to PATH. Please make any changes to the code publicly available.
